-- Fields are expected to be separated by commas. Per RFC
-- 4180, fields may be double-quoted: only whitespace, which
-- is discarded, may appear outside the double-quotes of a
-- quoted field. For unquoted fields, whitespace to the left
-- of the field is discarded, but whitespace to the right is
-- retained; this is convenient for the parser, and probably
-- corresponds to the typical intent of CSV authors. Whitespace
-- on both sides of a quoted field is discarded. If a
-- double-quoted fields contains two double-quotes in a row,
-- these are treated as an escaped encoding of a single
-- double-quote.
-- .
-- The final line of the input may end with a line terminator,
-- which will be ignored, or without one.
